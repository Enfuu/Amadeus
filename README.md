# Amadeus
A prototype voice assistant built by utilizing DarkSky forecast, Wikipedia, IBM Watson Speech-To-Text and Youtube API.

So far only the wikipedia and the weather methods are functional. For weather you will require a Dark Sky API key and for Voice recognition you will reqiure a IBM Watson Speech-To-Text API

# Commands
Currently Amadeus only supports the following commands 

"Whats your name?"

"Who made you?"

"How Are You?"

"Whats your birthday?"

"**Who is | Tell me about | Whose** <Name>?"
  
"**What is | Tell me about** <Thing>?"
  
"**What is | what's** the Weather?"
